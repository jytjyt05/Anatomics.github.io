Anatomics is a ready-to-use software for plant microscopy image segmentaion. Its backend is pytorch connectomics and its frontend is tkinter based GUI. 

We hope to provide plant biologists with easy access to AI-driven segmentation.

# Features
The software includes the following functions:
- Train an AI model
- Use an AI model to do auto-label and post-process
- Combine and split images or volumes
- Visualize in 2D or 3D

# Installation
- [ ] Since the Program requires "The PyTorch Connectomics package" which was mainly developed on Linux machines with NVIDIA GPUs, we recommend using **Linux** or **Windows** to ensure the compatibility of the latest features with your system. The instructions below are for **WINDOWS**. 
- [ ] Install Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) following their instructions. 
- [ ] Open the “Anaconda Prompt”. You should be able to find this in the windows start menu with your other programs. Either search for it, or look in the folder most likely called "Anaconda 3 (64-bit)" Another way to find it is by clicking the start menu / press the windows key, start typing miniconda, and select "Anaconda Prompt (Miniconda3)" 
- [ ] Install the program using the following commands. Please copy them by highlighting them all with your cursor, and then pressing CTRL+C, or right click and select copy. Then run them by pasting them into the terminal (either using CTRL+V or right clicking and click paste.). After you hit paste, the installation process should occur automatically. This may take a while. When it is done, it should print "Completely finished with installation. And the program will open automatically.

```bash 
cd Documents 
conda create --name plantTorch python=3.8.11 -y 
conda activate plantTorch 
conda install git -y 
git clone https://github.com/ajbrookhouse/WSU_PlantBio_ML.git 
cd WSU_PlantBio_ML 
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
conda install cudatoolkit=11.8 -c pytorch 
conda install h5py 
git clone https://github.com/ajbrookhouse/pytorch_connectomics 
cd pytorch_connectomics 
pip install --editable . 
cd .. 
pip install open3d 
pip install scikit-image 
pip install paramiko 
pip install pygubu 
pip install pandas 
pip install plyer 
pip install ttkthemes 
pip install connected-components-3d 
conda install -c conda-forge imagecodecs -y 
pip install neuroglancer 

echo Completely finished with installation. 
python GPU_test.py 
``` 

- If the program does not open. Please open the program by typing "python gui.py" in your terminal (Normally, this step should be completed automatically by the previous command copy section) 

The main program should now be visible on your screen:

# Update
Open miniconda by clicking start, typing miniconda, and selecting "Anaconda Prompt (Miniconda3)". Then type the following: 

```bash 
cd Documents 
cd WSU_PlantBio_ML 
git pull 
``` 

If an error is shown when trying to update, please type ‘git reset –hard'. After that use the command “git pull” to update the program.  

# Uninstallation 
If you need to **uninstall** the program for some reason (One reason could be getting a fresh install), do the following things. Close miniconda. Delete the WSU_PlantBio_ML folder and everything in it. Then open miniconda and type the following: 

```bash 
conda deactivate plantTorch (If your miniconda prompt lines start with (plantTorch). If they say (base), please skip this line/step) 
conda env remove -n plantTorch -y 
``` 

Now, all libraries used for the project will be uninstalled, and so will the reset of the program

If you no longer need miniconda for other programs, feel free to uninstall it like any other windows program.
